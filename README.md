# Does a small share of the police force account for one third of complaints?

[This FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/141182fc-7727-4af8-a555-5418fa46d09e) from 2012 claimed that police complaints in various US cities were disproportionally concentrated among the top 10% of police officers with the most complaints. During my fellowship in 2022, I was asked to replicate these findings using a dataset on police complaints in London Metrpolitan Police (MET). The code below demonstrates some statistical reasons for why it is impossible to drawn these kinds of conclusions from this type of data.

> This figure from the [2012 FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/141182fc-7727-4af8-a555-5418fa46d09e) illustrates the main claim of the article â€“ that a small proportion of police officers accumulate a disproportionate number of complaints. In this repo, I will show through simulation and analysis that this cannot be inferred from this data.
